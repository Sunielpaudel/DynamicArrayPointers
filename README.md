# Dynamic Smart Pointers Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of dynamic smart pointers in C++ for managing dynamic arrays. It allows users to input a series of numbers, which are stored in a dynamically growing array managed by std::unique_ptr. The program calculates and outputs the sum of the entered numbers.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. *Demonstrate Smart Pointer Usage*: 
   - Showcase the benefits of using smart pointers, specifically std::unique_ptr, for memory management in C++. This project highlights how smart pointers can help prevent memory leaks and enhance code safety by automatically managing memory allocation and deallocation.

2. *Implement Dynamic Array Functionality*:
   - Implement a dynamic array that can grow in size as needed based on user input. The project allows for an efficient way to manage and store an arbitrary number of integers without pre-defining the array size, simulating typical dynamic array behavior found in higher-level languages.

3. *Enhance User Interaction*:
   - Provide an interactive command-line interface for users to input numbers. Users can enter a series of integers and receive immediate feedback in the form of the total sum of their inputs, fostering an engaging user experience.

4. *Understand Memory Management Concepts*:
   - Offer insights into C++ memory management concepts, including heap vs. stack allocation, the importance of resource management, and how smart pointers help simplify these complexities for developers.

5. *Encourage Best Practices*:
   - Promote best practices in C++ programming, such as using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles with smart pointers, which improves code reliability and maintainability.

6. *Serve as an Educational Tool*:
   - Act as an educational resource for students and developers learning C++ and smart pointers. The project can be a stepping stone to more complex memory management techniques and data structures.

## Features
- Utilizes std::unique_ptr for automatic memory management.
- Dynamically resizes the array as needed to accommodate user input.
- Sums the entered numbers and displays the result.
